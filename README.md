## Issue Labels

Issues are either "open", meaning that it is actively impacting RAMIP datasets, or "closed", meanging that it was resolved and does not impact RAMIP datasets. Based on our current framework, most issues will remain open even if the problematic datasets are fixed because many users likely already downloaded them. To distinguish between issues that are unresolved versus fixed, labels are assigned to each issue by the repository admins. Additional labels are used to indicate the scope of the issue:

### Severity

`post-processing` - The formatting of the dataset is inconvient or incompatible with other datasets, but the underlying variable data is unaffected.

`coordinate` - The coordinate variables for a dataset are incompatible with other datasets, improperly formatted, or corrupted, but the underlying variable data is unaffected.

`critical` - The underlying values of the dataset are biased, corrupted, or demonstrably incorrect.

### Status

`source-fixed` - The issue is fixed at the source. Future downloads will be unaffected by the issue.

`patch-fixed` - The issue is fixed with additional post-processing or data handling. Future downloads will still have the issue.

## Contributing an Issue

If you find an issue not documented in this repo, please add it. To do this, you will need to be logged into a GitHub account. Navigate to the "Issues" page and click on the green button labled "New Issue":

GitHub should automatically prompt what type of issue you want to submit and then autopopulate with a template we created specifically for RAMIP issues. Fill out the template as thoroughly as possible. This will ensure the issue you found is well-documented and easy for others to identify. Note that GitHub currently does not support saving drafts of issues, so be careful not to lose any in-progress work.


## Tests
Python tests are available in `tests/` to be run on individual or multiple netCDF files. They do not catch all issues, but check for the most common ones. Check out `tutorial.ipynb` for how to use it.
